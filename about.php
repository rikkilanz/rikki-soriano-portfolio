                        <h3>The journey so far...</h3>
                        <h4>I</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <p>After graduating high school, as every gamers dream I wanted to be a Game Developer. After a few courses, I learned that it wasn't for me because I struggled to understand how to speak like a computer (ü§ñ *beep boop*).</p>
                        <p>While figuring out my future, I had a thought to pursue my media and design hobby because I was always intrigued on creating media and art with purpose.</p>
                        <p>I am thinking of creative ways to create solutions for problems whether that'd be telling a story through video, or presenting information through visual graphics.</p>
                        <h4>II</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <p>After I graduated from BCIT with a Graphic Design Certification in 2020. It was another struggle to land a job during the pandemic. I tried my own freelance work, getting a few clients to work with.</p>
                        <p>I never gave up on design. It was then I decided to take on the UIUX/Web Developer path after realizing that I could further expand my Graphic Design skills to creating amazing UI designs and bring them to life through development.</p>
                        <p>I've had my doubts at first coming back to a program with coding, but I remained optimistic and design made me feel comfortable around it. </p>
                        <h4>III</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Now, I enjoy coding as much as I enjoy creating designs. Design complimented Development and vice versa. </p>
                        <p>Voila! It all came to a full circle in the end. <b>The lesson?</b> I learned to be authentic with myself after knowing that I wanted to pursue a design career path. Learning new things like coding can be daunting. If you have a little spark of optimism in you, things will come back in full circle and that's when you know you've grown.</p>
