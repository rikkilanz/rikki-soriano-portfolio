                        <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                        <p>Before the sketching phase, I've researched and followed existing app design systems from other retail companies (H&M, Uniqlo, Shein). Most of the apps had a lot of images to highlight their products and use some sort of a gallery slider for users to browse. All of them are actually contained in a card to create some unity and content division</p>

                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Design Process</h3>
                        <p>The idea for the logo is to stick with the business branding of being a minimal clothing brand. I played around with a bunch of typefaces from serif to sans-serifs and ended up using Crimson Pro. The type's thick serifs and serious tone fits the brand really well of presenting minimalism with an organic and authentic feel.</p>

                        <h3>Design Process - Logo</h3>
                        <p>The approach for the logo design is create this premium, royalty look that I thought of for the brand.Explored different types script fonts to achieve that majestic look.</p>
                        <p>I chose Luna Sans for the full text which gives this premium look with it's letter terminals. For the icon, I used the font Altesse for it's cleaner flow, with thicker stems, and thinner terminals.</p>

                        <h3>Design Process - Website Style Tile</h3>
                        <p>The goal for the website aesthetic is carry on the premium/royalty feel. I think that the dark blue just compliments the gold color of the logo really well.</p>
