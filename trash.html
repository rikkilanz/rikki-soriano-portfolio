        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>I started coding the header first to be mobile responsive. During this, I also created a hamburger menu with Javascript as a project requirement. Afterwards, I started sectioning the contents and added necessary Javascript plugins for the functionality.</p>
            
        <p>As a project bonus, we were to add a video media when the browser reaches a desktop size. This was a struggle since the video was added as a background and doesn't size responsively (which I managed to do afterwards.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>Wireframing</h3>
        <p>The content of the website is layed out to be easily responsive. All of the content is center aligned because the purpose of the landing webpage is just to show content quick and in divided sections.</p>
        
        <p>The website is layed out base on information hierarchy. I used a gallery slider to highlight appealing visuals for users to capture their attention. It's proceeded with the companys mission and values to reinforce towards the users what the company's focus is on.</p>
        
        <p>The team is introduced afterwards, highlighting what they work as and a brief description about them. In this section, I also implemented on a Lightbox Javascript (when you click an Image, it zooms in your screen) to let users have the option see the image better.</p>
        
        <p>Finally a FAQ Section using an Accordion Javascript plugin to easily show and hide information without crowding the UI.</p>

        <h3>Design Process - Logo</h3>
        <p>The approach for the logo design is create this premium, royalty look that I thought of for the brand.Explored different types script fonts to achieve that majestic look.</p>
        <p>I chose Luna Sans for the full text which gives this premium look with it's letter terminals. For the icon, I used the font Altesse for it's cleaner flow, with thicker stems, and thinner terminals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>Design Process - Website Style Tile</h3>
        <p>The goal for the website aesthetic is carry on the premium/royalty feel. I think that the dark blue just compliments the gold color of the logo really well.</p>

                        <h3>Planning</h3>
                        <p>Before coding, there were a few requirements for this project.</p>

                        <ul class="list">
                            <li><p>Create a total of 5 sections</p></li>
                            <li><p>Implement a total of 3 Javascript plugins</p></li>
                            <li><p>Must be responsive for both mobile and desktop</p></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>With these requirements in mind, I had to plan out how I should lay out the website's information.</p>
                    </div>
                    <hr>
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Layout</h3>
                        <img src="" alt="">
                        <p>The content of the website is layed out to be easily responsive. All of the content is centre aligned because the purpose of the landing webpage is to show content quickly and in divided sections.</p>
                        
                        <p>I layed out the section in order of importance of information. I used the Javascript image slider plugin called Flickity to highlight appealing visuals for users to capture their attention. It then proceeds with the company's mission and values to reinforce the company's focus towards the users.</p>
                        
                        <p>The team is introduced afterwards, highlighting what their position is and a brief description about them. In this section, I also implemented a Lightbox Javascript (when you click an Image, it zooms in on your screen) to let users have the option to see the image better.</p>
                        
                        <p>Finally a FAQ Section using an Accordion Javascript plugin to easily show and hide information without crowding the UI.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Coding Process</h3>
                        <h4>Gallery Section</h4>
                        <img src="" alt="">
                        <p>In this section, I used the Javascript plugin Flickity. I have images that highlight house properties.</p>
                        <img src="" alt="">
                        <p>At higher resolution display, the image slider is replaced with a drone video that hovers over houses which is consistent with other real estate websites. Both the slider and video plays automatically so that the user's attention would be captured easily.</p>
                        <p>This section took the most time to code because I had to play around with the code so that the image and video fit well so that it wouldn't be squished. One issue I had was that the video wasn't responding properly at different screen resolutions where it was creating unnecessary spacing at the top. I found out that the container had a top CSS attribute that was pushing it down, which I initially placed because the header was position fixed.</p>
                        <h4>Team Section</h4>
                        <p>In this section, I created a card class to contain images and corresponding information on the image. This card class was easy to reuse, especially when I have to display more than 1 person in this section.</p>
                        <img src="" alt="">
                        <p>This section also uses the Javascript plugin, lightbox-js. This plugin highlights the images when the user clicks on it where they can read further information about them.</p>
                        <h4>FAQ Section</h4>
                        <p>In this section, I used the Javascript library jQuery to take advantage of their accordion component. An accordion fits well in this FAQ section because most questions are around 1-2 sentences with answers ranging to a few sentences.</p>
                        <img src="" alt="">
                        <p>This way, we can display what the commonly asked question is while hiding any information that may distractingly populate the screen.

                        <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
                        <p>This is a project that I worked on with a time constraint of 3 weeks. I would further improve this project by taking advantage of tools like Sass to organise my styles, creating more reusable components like sections, grid systems, and cards.</p>
